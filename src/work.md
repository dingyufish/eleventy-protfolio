            <h3>Sunflowers represent positive attitudes to a better life. 
            This is my graphic design, sunflower in the bottle. The pink background makes the picture more soft, 
            sunflower, growing in different directions. 
            Blue bottle and pink background form a soft contrast.</h3>

            <h3>This is my other flat design, fruit basket and fruit. It is done using the Illustrator software.
             I use strong contrast to reflect the characteristics of different fruits, 
            and the highlight shadows in the form of color block make objects more stereo.</h3>

            <h2>UI design "On Track"</h2>
            <h4>On Track is a calendar tool for CUNY Students. 
            Determined to simplify the time management of students and improve the efficiency of communication between students. 
            This APP pursues a simple and efficient interface. Simplify the steps of setting up the calendar by synchronizing the CUNY blackboard.
            Because this project target for students, a simple and convenient communication page is necessary. Therefore, classrooms post a place
             for students communicating with each other. The system will automatically create a classroom based on the information synchronized from
              the blackboard, or user can create a classroom by themselves.  </h4>
